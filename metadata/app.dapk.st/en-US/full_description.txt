<i>SmallTalk</i> is a minimal messenger using the Matrix protocol. It has a comparingly tiny app size and focuses on reliability and stability. Its feature set is rather bare-bones:

* Login with Matrix ID/Password
* Combined Room and DM interface
* End to end encryption
* Message bubbles, supporting text, replies and edits
* Push notifications (DMs always notify, Rooms notify once)
* Importing of E2E room keys from Element clients
* <a href='https://unifiedpush.org/' target='_blank' rel='nofollow'>UnifiedPush</a>

More to come in the future.
